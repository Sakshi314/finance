1. Requirements Gathering and Workflow:

For point one (Planning & Requirements Gathering), we need to clarify all functional and non-functional requirements, workflows, and technology choices. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown to guide this phase:


---

A. Functional Requirements

1. User Management:

Registration & Authentication:

Users can register with email, password, and social login (Google, Facebook via OAuth2).

Secure login with JWT token-based authentication.


User Profiles:

Manage personal details (name, email, profile picture, etc.).


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Admin users with elevated permissions.

Standard users with limited access.




2. Financial Transaction Management:

Add/Edit/Delete Transactions:

Users can manually add, edit, or delete financial transactions (income, expense).

Transaction categorization (e.g., food, rent, travel).


Recurring Transactions:

Support for recurring income and expenses (e.g., monthly salary, rent).


Import Bank Statements (optional):

Users can upload or link bank accounts to import transactions automatically (via API integration with banking services).




3. Budgets and Goals:

Set Budgets:

Users can set monthly/weekly budgets for various categories (e.g., food, rent, etc.).


Goal Setting:

Users can set financial goals (e.g., saving $5000 by year-end) and track progress.




4. AI-Powered Insights:

Spending Analysis:

AI analyzes historical spending patterns and predicts future expenses.


Personalized Suggestions:

Suggestions on how users can save money, reduce spending in certain categories, or manage finances better.


Alerts: Notifications when nearing or exceeding budgets.



5. Reporting & Visualization:

Dashboard:

A user-friendly dashboard showing an overview of expenses, income, and savings.


Category-Based Reports:

Breakdown of expenses by category with visual charts (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).


Exportable Reports:

Generate downloadable reports (PDF, CSV) for transactions, budgets, and financial summaries.




6. Notifications & Alerts:

Budget Alerts:

Alerts when users exceed their set budget.


Goal Progress Alerts:

Notifications for financial goal milestones or missed targets.


Recurring Transaction Alerts:

Reminders for recurring expenses and income.




7. Real-Time Updates:

Real-Time Transaction Processing:

New transactions or budget changes reflected instantly on the dashboard.


Push Notifications:

Send notifications to users in real-time for important updates or insights.






---

B. Non-Functional Requirements

1. Scalability:

The system must handle a large number of concurrent users and high transaction volumes.

Dynamic scaling through Kubernetes or serverless computing to accommodate peak loads.



2. Performance:

API response times should be under 200ms for most operations.

Efficient database indexing and caching (Redis) to improve performance.



3. Security:

Ensure data encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (PostgreSQL encryption).

Implement robust authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.

Protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).



4. Availability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with load balancing and horizontal scaling.

Auto-recovery in case of failures (Kubernetes self-healing).



5. Maintainability:

Modular microservice-based architecture, making it easy to update, debug, and scale.

Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and quick rollbacks.



6. Extensibility:

The architecture should allow easy addition of new features (e.g., new transaction categories or insights).

Versioning of APIs to ensure backward compatibility with future features.





---

C. Workflow

1. User Journey

Registration/Login:

User signs up with email/password or social login (OAuth2).

Upon registration, the system generates a profile and assigns a JWT token for secure access.


Setting up Financial Accounts:

User manually enters income sources and expenses, categorizing them (e.g., rent, groceries).

Option to link bank accounts (via API) for auto-importing transactions (optional in later phases).


Creating Budgets and Goals:

User sets a budget for different expense categories and defines financial goals.


AI Insights & Predictions:

Based on historical transactions, the AI suggests potential savings, future expense predictions, and budget adjustments.


Reporting and Dashboard:

User can view a financial dashboard that visualizes income, expenses, and savings over time.

Users get alerts when budgets are exceeded or goals are met.


Notifications:

Real-time alerts and notifications are sent when a transaction is recorded or a budget is exceeded.

D. Technology Stack

1. Frontend:

React.js: To build a fast, responsive UI for the user-facing web application.

Apollo Client (GraphQL): For efficient data fetching and real-time updates.

SASS/Styled Components: For flexible styling and CSS management.

Chart.js/D3.js: For interactive data visualization (graphs, charts for expense breakdown).


2. Backend (Microservices Architecture):

Node.js (Express): For building lightweight, non-blocking microservices (transaction service, user service, etc.).

GraphQL: As an API Gateway to aggregate data from multiple microservices.

Python (AI Service): For running AI/ML algorithms to generate spending predictions and insights.

Message Broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka): For handling asynchronous communication and event-driven interactions between services.


3. Databases:

PostgreSQL: Relational database to store user profiles, transactions, budgets, and predictions.

Redis: For caching frequently accessed data, reducing load on the database.


4. AI/ML Infrastructure:

Python (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow): For building and serving AI models that predict spending habits and generate financial insights.

Jupyter Notebooks: For data exploration and model building during development.


5. Infrastructure & DevOps:

Docker: Containerization of all microservices for consistency across environments.

Kubernetes: For orchestrating, scaling, and managing Docker containers across multiple nodes.

NGINX/AWS ALB: Load balancer to distribute traffic across microservice instances.

CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Jenkins): To automate testing, building, and deploying services.

Terraform/Ansible: For automating the setup of cloud infrastructure and environments.


6. Security:

OAuth2 & JWT: For secure user authentication and authorization.

TLS/SSL: To ensure encrypted communication between users and services.

HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager: For securely managing credentials and API keys.


7. Monitoring & Logging:

Prometheus & Grafana: For collecting metrics (API performance, system health) and visualizing them in dashboards.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Centralized logging for tracking application logs, debugging, and troubleshooting.



---

E. Third-Party Integrations (Optional/Future Scope)

1. Plaid/Yodlee API: For integrating with user bank accounts to automatically import transactions.


2. Email/SMS APIs (Twilio, SendGrid): For sending alerts, notifications, and reminders.




---

F. Deliverables for Point One:

Detailed Functional Requirements Document: Capture all system features.

Non-Functional Requirements Document: Focus on performance, scalability, and security.

User Workflows: Define user journeys and interactions with the system.

Technology Stack Selection: Finalize choices for frontend, backend, infrastructure, and security.

Once these requirements are fully defined, we can move forward to the next phase: setting up the infrastructure and creating the basic skeleton of the system.
